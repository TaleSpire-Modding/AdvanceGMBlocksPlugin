# Advanced GM Blocks
[![Nuget Published](https://github.com/TaleSpire-Modding/AdvanceGMBlocksPlugin/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TaleSpire-Modding/AdvanceGMBlocksPlugin/actions/workflows/release.yml)

This plugin is designed to give GM Blocks more flexibility in how they use it to adjust their environment. For example, you can now use GM blocks solely for Audio/Ambience queues, such as a BBEG entering the scene. You may not want to adjust your perfectly lit atmosphere, but adjust the audio so that this allows you to disable the override so that only the audio tracks and levels change whilst the atmosphere stays the same. Then queue dusk as the battle draws out, you use another GM block to transition atmosphere without interupting the music. This mod will bring extra flexibility to the table with more dynamic controls. Because this is a GM tool, only the GM needs this installed for them to benefit from it.

## Usage

This plugin works by providing the GM block Radial UI component with a new Filter button. This branches out into 3 sub-categories, Audio, Mixer, and Atmosphere (Reflecting the Side Panel UI Categories). From ther,e they branch off to the togglable buttons that allow you to disable/re-enable overrides for that specific GM block. Meaning with small extra work in advance, you can fully utilize these GM blocks how they were intended. ON THE FLY.
